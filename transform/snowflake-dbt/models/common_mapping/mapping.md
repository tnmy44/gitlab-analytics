{% docs map_moved_duplicated_issue %}

Table mapping issues to the latest issue they were moved and / or duplicated to.

Example:

`Issue A` is moved to `Issue B`, `Issue B` is closed as duplicate of `Issue C`, `Issue C` is moved to `Issue D`

Then in our mapping table we would have:

| issue_id | last_moved_duplicated_issue_id | dim_issue_sk |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Issue A | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |
| Issue B | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |
| Issue C | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |
| Issue D | Issue D | Surrogate Key for Issue D |

{% docs map_subscription_opportunity %}

The distinct combination of subscriptions and opportunities generated through the rules defined in `prep_subscription_opportunity_mapping`. A flag has been created to indicate the subscription-opportunty mappings filled in by taking the most recent opportunity_id associated with a version of the subscription with the same subscription_name which we believe to have the lowest level of fidelity.

This table is the distinct combination of the Gitlab team members and there Gitlab user IDs.  The two values are connected using the Gitlab user names that is recorded in the HRIS system

{% enddocs %}

{% docs map_latest_subscription_namespace_monthly %}

This table contains the most recent subscription version associated with each namespace in each month, and represents the most complete namespace <> subscription mapping we have. It prefers the Zuora namespace <> subscription mappings, then fills in any nulls with bridge logic. The end objective is to backfill Zuora with all mappings so that `dim_subscription` can be the SSOT for namespace <> subscription relationships.

Although in the prep data, namespaces can be associated with multiple `dim_subscription_id`s and/or multiple `dim_subscription_id_original`s in a single month, we use a `QUALIFY` statement in this table to limit down to **one** subscription per namespace per month (the most recently created subscription).
