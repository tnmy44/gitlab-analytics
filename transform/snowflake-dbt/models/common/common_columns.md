{% docs code_suggestions_delivery_type %}

This is the delivery type of GitLab to include either SaaS or Self-Managed.

To derive this attribute, we join the instance information (`instance_id`, `host_name`) sent in the Code Suggestions context to find the delivery type from the installation that sent the event. We coalesce this delivery type with the `realm` (delivery type) sent in the context. This adjusts for the `Dedicated` instances that are labeled as Self-Managed in the context, but are considered to be SaaS delivery types.

{% docs connect_end %}

This attribute must return the time immediately after the user agent finishes establishing the connection to the server to retrieve the current document. If a persistent connection is used or the current document is retrieved from relevant application caches or local resources, this attribute must return the value of domainLookupEnd

If the transport connection fails and the user agent reopens a connection, connectStart and connectEnd should return the corresponding values of the new connection.

`connect_end` must include the time interval to establish the transport connection as well as other time interval such as SSL handshake and SOCKS authentication.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs connect_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent start establishing the connection to the server to retrieve the document. If a persistent connection is used or the current document is retrieved from relevant application caches or local resources, this attribute must return value of domainLookupEnd.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dom_complete %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent sets the current document readiness to "complete".

If the current document readiness changes to the same state multiple times, `dom_loading`, `dom_interactive`, `dom_content_loaded_event_start`, `dom_content_loaded_event_end` and `dom_complete` must return the time of the first occurrence of the corresponding document readiness change.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dom_content_loaded_event_end %}

This attribute must return the time immediately after the document's `dom_content_loaded` event completes.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dom_content_loaded_event_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent fires the `dom_content_loaded` event at the Document.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dom_interactive %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent sets the current document readiness to "interactive".

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dom_loading %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent sets the current document readiness to "loading".

{% enddocs %}

{% docs domain_lookup_end %}

This attribute must return the time immediately after the user agent finishes the domain name lookup for the current document. If a persistent connection is used or the current document is retrieved from relevant application caches or local resources, this attribute must return the same value as `fetch_start`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs domain_lookup_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent starts the domain name lookup for the current document. If a persistent connection is used or the current document is retrieved from relevant application caches or local resources, this attribute must return the same value as `fetch_start`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fetch_start %}

If the new resource is to be fetched using HTTP GET or equivalent, `fetch_start` must return the time immediately before the user agent starts checking any relevant application caches. Otherwise, it must return the time when the user agent starts fetching the resource.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs load_event_end %}

This attribute must return the time when the load event of the current document is completed. It must return zero when the load event is not fired or is not completed.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs load_event_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the load event of the current document is fired. It must return zero when the load event is not fired yet.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs navigation_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately after the user agent finishes prompting to unload the previous document. If there is no previous document, this attribute must return the same value as `fetch_start`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs redirect_end %}

If there are HTTP redirects or equivalent when navigating and all redirects and equivalents are from the same origin, this attribute must return the time immediately after receiving the last byte of the response of the last redirect. Otherwise, this attribute must return zero.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs redirect_start %}

If there are HTTP redirects or equivalent when navigating and if all the redirects or equivalent are from the same origin, this attribute must return the starting time of the fetch that initiates the redirect. Otherwise, this attribute must return zero.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs request_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent starts requesting the current document from the server, or from relevant application caches or from local resources.

If the transport connection fails after a request is sent and the user agent reopens a connection and resend the request, `request_start` should return the corresponding values of the new request.

This interface does not include an attribute to represent the completion of sending the request, e.g., `request_end`.

Completion of sending the request from the user agent does not always indicate the corresponding completion time in the network transport, which brings most of the benefit of having such an attribute.
Some user agents have high cost to determine the actual completion time of sending the request due to the HTTP layer encapsulation.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs response_end %}

This attribute must return the time immediately after the user agent receives the last byte of the current document or immediately before the transport connection is closed, whichever comes first. The document here can be received either from the server, relevant application caches or from local resources.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs response_start %}

This attribute must return the time immediately after the user agent receives the first byte of the response from the server, or from relevant application caches or from local resources.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs secure_connection_start %}

{% enddocs %}

{% docs unload_event_end %}

If the previous document and the current document have the same same origin, this attribute must return the time immediately after the user agent finishes the unload event of the previous document. If there is no previous document or the previous document has a different origin than the current document or the unload is not yet completed, this attribute must return zero.

If there are HTTP redirects or equivalent when navigating and not all the redirects or equivalent are from the same origin, both `unload_event_start` and `unload_event_end` must return the zero.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs unload_event_start %}

If the previous document and the current document have the same origin, this attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent starts the unload event of the previous document. If there is no previous document or the previous document has a different origin than the current document, this attribute must return zero.
