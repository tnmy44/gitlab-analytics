      This new table will not include every daily snapshot.

      throughout each quarter. This approach is designed to observe and analyze the key trends and
      activities occurring each week within the quarter.

      This query aggregates key sales metrics and attributes from
      the actuals table to the weekly grain and across multiple dimensions
      like sales source, order type, hierarchy, stage, deal path.
      This table also computes quarterly totals and adds them as non additive
      measures to each row, to facilitate pipeline velocity and coverage calculation in Tableau.
  - name: wk_rpt_targets_actuals_multi_grain
    description: >
      This report table consolidates data:
      - At the opportunity level for the current quarter
      - Aggregate data on a weekly basis for previous quarters
      - Targets
      It serves as a singular source for creating pipeline visualizations in Tableau,
      offering a comprehensive view across different timeframes. This report is a multi
      grain table, since the data is at 3 different levels of granularity.
  - name: wk_mart_targets_actuals_7th_day_weekly_snapshot
    description: >
      This mart table simplifies tracking sales performance by showing targets and
      actuals combined, every seven days within a quarter.
      It combines daily targets, daily actuals along with the total quarterly targets and actuals. This
      model includes both the numerator and denominator for calculating coverage throughout a quarter
