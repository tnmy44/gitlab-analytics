      `mart_crm_opportunity_stamped_hierarchy_hist` accounts for yearly changes in the sales hierarchy, views all account hierarchies through the lens of the current year hierarchy, and it reflects how the sales hierarchy is applied in practice (ie. Hybrid users are assigned to the account's hierarchy).
      Also, for the `alliance_type` field it has the current state of the field instead of the historical version of it. For example,
      instead of showing the value Non-Alliance it shows Channel Partners.
